NRF24L01 Lib for ARDUINO
                                                                                                           
This code was painstakenly written a number of years ago to interface with the NRF42L01 chip for a few wireless robots I was working on.
The chip is an amazing product, but it is quite complex, hence the need for a library like this. Let me know if it's helpful - I'm interested!
I didn't define every single flag in the datasheet, but the basic functionality and a little extra is all here. Feel free to contribute.

Enjoy!
