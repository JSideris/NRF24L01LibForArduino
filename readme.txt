NRF24L01 Lib for ARDUINO

About This Library
• Minimalistic: very easy to get started with and to understand what's going on (if you need to).
• Easy to use: minimal effort required to get up and running out of the box.
• Does not rely on Arduino's built-in SPI!!!!

Notes:
I didn't define every single flag in the datasheet, but the basic functionality and a little extra is all here. 
This library doesn't support every feature of the chip yet For instance: using different data pipes. 
Feel free to contribute. And of course, report bugs. This hasn't been tested in a while :).

Enjoy!
